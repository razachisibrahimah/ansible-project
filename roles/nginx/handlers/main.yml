# Handlers for Nginx role
# These handlers are triggered ONLY when templates or configs actually change.

# NOTE:
#  reload nginx = preferred, does NOT interrupt existing connections
#  restart nginx = only when explicitly triggered (e.g., port change, module enable)

- name: reload nginx
  become: yes
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: reloaded

# Safety-only. Not used normally.
- name: restart nginx
  become: yes
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
